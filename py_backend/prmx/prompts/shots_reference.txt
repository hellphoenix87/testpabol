Translate the following movie script precisely into the shot notation. "Content" only contains concise visual information of the current camera frame. The shot content will exclusively feature characters using references like "<Character X>," referring to the characters listed above. Never explicitly name characters in the shot content, only refer to their references. Use "Shot Type" to describe the camera frame. Both "Location" and "Shot Type" must be numbers, corresponding to the lists above.
"Sound" depicts the ambient acoustic environment, excluding any mention of the soundtrack music or dialogue (people talking).
In most shots, there is only one dialog line or dialog at all. Therefore, the camera can precisely follow the action. If there is much action going on in the screen, divide it into multiple shots to precisely narrate step by step.
The character who speaks the dialog line must be mentioned in the content description, unless it's off-screen or voice-over.
A single dialog line can also span across two shots, it is then marked with (CONT'D) to note that there's no pause.
