Here's the movie for which you should list the characters:

Plot: "{{PLOT}}"

Write a character list of all required characters in the movie PRECISELY in the format of the example character shown above. Don't append information before or after their names (like "Supporting Actor"). Don't use sentences, only key points. Only individual characters, no group of characters (like "friends", "family members"). If the name of a character is not mentioned in the plot, invent a new name (first and last name). Also include supporting roles, which are not explicitly mentioned in the plot (like family members, narrator, friends and everyone else who has a dialog line in the movie). Start every character in the list with "Name:".
The list contains all characters which will have a spoken line in the movie. Usually, a movie has about 10 characters. It can be less if the movie is centered around few characters. Finish your list if you think you added all characters.
