      <p className="mb-2">
        September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the AI movie generator and distribution platform &ldquo;pabolo&rdquo; (&ldquo;
        <strong>Platform</strong>&rdquo;) available at https://www.pabolo.ai (&ldquo;<strong>Website</strong>&rdquo;),
        which you (&ldquo;<strong>User</strong>, &ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&rdquo;) can use as &ldquo;
        <strong>Creator</strong>&rdquo; to create films and share them via the Platform with other Users; and as
        &ldquo;<strong>Viewer</strong>&rdquo; to discover, watch and comment on films available at the Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The provider of the Platform is pabolo GmbH, Albert-Nestler-Str. 10, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany, represented by
        the managing director Thomas Hans Willberger (&ldquo;<strong>pabolo</strong>&rdquo;, "<strong>we</strong>
        &rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo;). You can contact us as follows: phone +49(0)157-58252145, e-mail
        contact@pabolo.ai.
      </p>
      <p>
        These terms of use (&ldquo;<strong>Terms of Use</strong>&rdquo;) apply to the use of the Platform, and the
        contract concluded between pabolo and you when registering to use the Platform. They consist of the five parts:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li>
          &ldquo;General Terms for the use of the Platform&rdquo; (Part I. of the Terms of Use) applicable to all
          Users,
        </li>
        <li>&ldquo;Special Terms for Creators&rdquo; (Part II. of the Terms of Use),</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Special Terms for Viewers&rdquo; (Part III. of the Terms of Use),</li>
        <li>
          &ldquo;Terms of the right to withdrawal&rdquo; (Part IV. of the Terms of Use), and &ldquo;Service
          Description&rdquo; (Part V. of the Terms of Use).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some of the Terms of Use only apply if you are a consumer within the meaning of Section 13 of the German Civil
        Code (B&uuml;rgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)) or a business owner within the meaning of Section 14 BGB. You are a
        consumer if you are using the Platform for a purpose that can predominantly be attributed neither to your
        commercial nor to your independent professional activity. Business owners, on the other hand, are natural or
        legal persons or partnerships with legal capacity that, when concluding the legal transaction, act in the
        exercise of their commercial or self-employed professional activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have your own general terms and conditions, we hereby expressly object to their application and you
        agree that your deviating, contradictory and supplementary general terms and conditions do not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use are available electronically at the URL https://www.pabolo.ai/legal in printable and
        storable form. The contract language is English.

      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">I. General terms for the use of the Platform</h1>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">1. Registration, conclusion of User Contract</h2>
      <p>
        1.1 To comment and vote on Films (see Part III. 1 of the Terms of Use) and to be able to conclude a fee-based
        contract on the use of the AI Tool as a Creator (see Part II. 2 of the Terms of Use) you need to register at
        the Website and create a user account ("<strong>User Account</strong>"). For registration we will ask you to
        enter an e-mail address and a password. Until registration is completed, you can review and, if necessary,
        correct the information provided in the registration form at any time. If you are registered as a user with
        other online services and pabolo provides for automatic data transfer, you can consent to have your data
        transferred automatically to create your User Account. After registration, we will send you an e-mail
        confirming the registration&nbsp; ("<strong>Registration Confirmation</strong>"). Upon receipt of the
        Registration Confirmation, the contract between you and us regarding the use of the Platform ("
        <strong>User Contract</strong>") comes into effect. We will store the text of the User Contract (Registration
        Confirmation and Terms of Use), but it will not be available for you online later.
      </p>
      <p>1.2 The User Contract runs for an indefinite period.</p>
      <p>
        1.3 If you are a consumer you are entitled to a right to withdrawal from the User Contract in accordance with
        the conditions set forth in Part IV of the Terms of Use.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.4 Only natural persons with a minimum age of 16 years can register. However, users under the age of 18
        require the consent of their parents or other legal guardians.
      </p>
      <p>1.5 The registration is free of charge.</p>
      <p>
        1.6 Your User Account is linked to a profile (&ldquo;<strong>Profile</strong>
        &rdquo;) that will be visible to other Users as soon as you publish a film on the Platform or comment or vote
        on it. You can add and change information (e.g. a username and a photo) in the Profile (&ldquo;
        <strong>Profile Information</strong>&rdquo;) at any time via your User Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.7 You may not pass on your password to third parties and must keep it secret and change it immediately if you
        have knowledge of misuse or only suspect or fear such misuse. You are liable for all damages caused by third
        party use of the User Account unless you are not at fault for such third-party use. If there is a risk of
        misuse of the password, you must inform us immediately by e-mail to support@pabolo.ai.
      </p>
      <p>1.8 You are not allowed to transfer the User Account to a third party.</p>
      <p>
        1.9 You have no right to registration as user of the Platform. We can temporarily block access to a User
        Account if we have a justified interest in doing so. When we decide on a blocking of access, we consider your
        interests and our interests to the same extent. If we block your User Account, we will inform you in text form,
        e.g. by e-mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We communicate with you electronically using the email address which you provided at
        registration.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2. Scope of services, updates and changes</h2>
      <p>
        2.1 We offer the Platform as beta version, i.e. with restrictions, in particular with regard to stability,
        freedom from errors and the scope of functions. You can find further information on functionality,
        compatibility, and interoperability of the Platform in the Service Description below (see Part V of the Terms
        of Use) and on the Website.
      </p>
      <p>2.2 We will grant you access to all updates that are required for the contractual use of the Platform.</p>
      <p>
        2.3 In addition, to these updates, we reserve the right to further develop, adapt or otherwise change the
        Platform and/or the functionalities or services available at the Platform without charging the User additional
        costs when a valid reason requires such change. We will inform you about such change in a transparent and
        comprehensible form.
      </p>
      <h4>
        2.3.1&nbsp; There is a valid reason if the change is necessary to adapt the Platform and/or the functionalities
        or services available at the Platform to new technical requirements (e.g. technical environment or operational
        reasons), because of changes in the market (e.g. increased number of users), because of changes in legal
        requirements or jurisdiction, or if the changes are made for the benefit of the User (e.g. to improve security
        or expand the scope of functions). For this purpose, we may also change, expand, restrict, or discontinue the
        Platform and/or the functionalities or services available in the Platform.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        2.3.2&nbsp; If we make changes to the Platform that affect your ability to access and/or use the Platform
        and/or the functionalities or services available at the Platform to a significant extent (&ldquo;Significant
        Change&rdquo;), we will inform you in text form (e.g. via e-mail) within a reasonable period before the time of
        the Significant Change. You may terminate the User&nbsp;Contract and/or Subscription Contract (see Part II. 2
        of the Terms of Use) within thirty (30) days after receipt of the information about the Significant Change or,
        if the Significant Change occurs after the receipt of the information, after we have made the Significant
        Change of the function, unless we provide you with the Platform in the previous version without charging you
        additional costs.
      </h4>
      <p>
        2.4 Maintenance work, retrofits or upgrades, errors or bugs and other causes or circum-stances may lead to
        interruptions or defects in the operation of the Platform. We will remedy technical failure as soon as possible
        within the scope of technical possibilities. We offer the Platform with an availability of 95% per year. The
        availability rate results from the ratio of the hours during which the Platform is available to the total
        number of hours in the calendar year. When calculating availability, downtime caused by circumstances beyond
        pabolo's control are not included.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">II. Special Terms for Creators</h1>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">1. AI Tool for the creation and publication of films</h2>
      <p>
        1.1 pabolo offers Creators access to a browser-based software (Software as a Service, SaaS) which uses
        Artificial Intelligence (&ldquo;<strong>AI Tool</strong>&rdquo;) to create and publish films.
      </p>
      <h4>
        1.1.1&nbsp; Based on the Creator's selected metadata (e.g. genre, storyline, locations and characters) and his
        prompts, the AI Tool automatically writes the film plot, creates the images, and combines them with sound and
        music. The results are displayed to the Creator in a dashboard. The Creator cannot edit and modify them once
        they have been published (the final product is hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Film&rdquo;). The Film will
        initially consist of a slide show of film stills that the Creator can add music and sound to. pabolo will at a
        later stage enhance the functionality of the AI Tool so that the Creator will be able to produce moving images
        with the AI Tool. The Creator can interrupt the production process at any time and save the interim result in
        his User Account, which can then be used to resume the creation process.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        1.1.2&nbsp; pabolo will use any data, prompts, modifications, or other information selected and/or entered by
        the Creator during the creation of the film is (jointly referred to as &ldquo;Creator&acute;s Data&rdquo;) only
        for the provision of the Platform and the services provided via the Platform. This includes the right to use
        the Creator&acute;s Data to train and further develop the AI Tool. For this purpose, pabolo will include the
        Creator&acute;s Data in pabolo&acute;s data collections and data bases, and store, connect, process and/or
        otherwise use them within pabolo&acute;s AI Tool. The storage of the Creator&acute;s Data, however, is not the
        subject of the Usage Contract, which is why pabolo is not obliged to hold the Creator&acute;s Data for the
        Creator and to return it to the Creator after the end of the Subscription Contract. The Creator&acute;s Data
        will not be accessible by other Users.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        1.1.3&nbsp; The Creator acknowledges and accepts that all results generated by the AI Tool are results of an
        automatic calculation and in particular rely on the type, content and quality of the Creator's Data entered by
        the Creator. Therefore, beyond providing the contracted functionalities of the AI Tool, pabolo is not liable to
        produce and deliver a specific result or a result of a specific quality.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        1.1.4&nbsp; The Creator is not entitled to use the AI Tool beyond the agreed use or to have it used by third
        parties or to make it accessible to third parties. In particular, the Creator is prohibited from duplicating,

      <p>
        4.1 Creators must pay a fee for the use of the AI Tool (&ldquo;
        <strong>Fee</strong>&rdquo;). You can find information on our Fee rates on the Website
        https://www.pabolo.ai/feature. All Fees are gross fees, including applicable VAT at the time of the conclusion
        of the Subscription Contract. We will inform you about the applicable Fee in a summary before you order a

        <strong>Due Date</strong>&rdquo;). pabolo will collect Fees that are due for payment immediately.
      </p>

        Creator of the respective payment methods available at the beginning of the registration process for a
        subscription. The Creator might have to agree to additional terms of use of the respective payment service
        provider.
      </p>
      <h4>
        4.3.1&nbsp; In order to pay the Fee using PayPal, the Creator must open a PayPal account or already have such
        an account. pabolo will redirect the Creator to the website of the provider PayPal (Europe) S.&agrave; r.l. et
        Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg, (hereinafter "PayPal") during the ordering process.
        PayPal will ask the Creator to prove their identity by entering their access data, to instruct the payment to
        pabolo and to complete the order. PayPal will carry out the payment transaction and debit the Creator&acute;s
        account after the conclusion of the Subscription Contract and the Due Date of the respective Fee.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        4.3.2&nbsp; When choosing to pay the Fee by Credit Card, pabolo will process payment using the payment service
        provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd, 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, Ireland (hereinafter
        "Stripe"). The Creator can enter their card details during the registration process on the Platform. The

        credit card will be charged after the conclusion of the Subscription Contract and the Due Date of the
        respective Fee.

        4.4 If the Creator does not pay the Fee or if amounts paid are reversed or charged back, pabolo shall be
        entitled to block the access to the Creator's User Account, subject to further claims. If the blocking takes
        place because of open payment claims and these are balanced, pabolo will unblock the User Account. If pabolo
        blocks the access to the User Account, pabolo informs the Creator about the blocking in text form, e.g. by
        e-mail. pabolo&acute;s right to terminate the Subscription Contract according to Part II. 3 of the Terms of Use
        remains unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.5 pabolo shall be entitled to change the Fee rates agreed with the Creator if the costs attributable to the
        provision of the Platform to Creators change after the conclusion of the Subscription Contract due to
        circumstances that could not be foreseen and that pabolo cannot control ("
        <strong>Change of Costs</strong>"). The costs attributable to the provision of the Platform to Creators
        comprise the following: costs for technical services, customer service and other costs of sale (e.g. invoicing
        and payment, marketing), general administrative costs (e.g. costs for personnel, services providers, IT
        systems, rent and energy) and government-imposed fees, contributions, taxes and levies. pabolo shall be
        entitled to increase the Fee rates only once within a calendar year and only in the amount that the costs
        attributable to the provision of the Platform to Creators have increased and have not been counterbalanced by
        cost savings elsewhere. pabolo will inform the Creator of the price change at least six (6) weeks before it
        takes effect. If the Creator does not agree with the change, the Creator can terminate the Subscription
        Contract within four (4) weeks after receipt of that information with effect to the date the change is going to
        take effect specified in the information. If the Creator does not object, the Subscription Contract will
        continue with the new Fee rates from the date of change on. pabolo will explicitly draw the Creator&acute;s
        attention to your right of objection and to the deadline.
